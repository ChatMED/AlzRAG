name: alzheimers_umls_extraction
description: |
  Extract UMLS-related entities from a document chunk related to Alzheimer's disease.
  The extraction should focus on entities representing medical concepts,
  including diseases, genes, proteins, drugs, symptoms, anatomical structures,
  and biological processes relevant to Alzheimer's disease.

  Entities should be categorized with UMLS semantic types where possible.
  If a specific UMLS CUI is known, include it in the "entity_id" field.
  Otherwise, mark the "entity_id" field as null.

  You are an expert at extracting medical entities related to Alzheimer's disease.
  Your goal is to identify UMLS-related concepts in the text and categorize them
  using relevant UMLS semantic types. If the text contains specific UMLS CUIs, include
  them in the output.

  Here are some examples of properly extracted entities:

  # Example 1
  Text: Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
  Output:
  ```json
  [
    {"entity_name": "Amyloid Plaques", "entity_category": "Pathologic Process", "entity_id": null},
    {"entity_name": "Neurofibrillary Tangles", "entity_category": "Pathologic Process", "entity_id": null},
    {"entity_name": "Alzheimer's Disease", "entity_category": "Disease or Syndrome", "entity_id": null}
