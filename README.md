# AlzRAG: A Specialized RAG System for Alzheimer's Research

## Overview

AlzRAG is a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed specifically for Alzheimer's disease research and clinical information. Built on top of the powerful R2R (Retrieval to Riches) framework, AlzRAG enhances the medical research experience by providing context-aware, evidence-based responses to complex queries about Alzheimer's disease, treatments, research findings, and clinical information.

## Features

- **Specialized Medical Knowledge Graph**: Optimized for Alzheimer's research with entity extraction focused on medical terminology, treatments, and research findings
- **Context-Enriched Chunks**: Enhanced document chunking with medical context preservation
- **Alzheimer's-Specific Hybrid Search**: Optimized vector and semantic search for medical terminology and concepts
- **Citation-Based Responses**: All generated content includes citations to original research papers and clinical guidelines
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Process and analyze text, images (MRIs, PET scans), and structured clinical data
- **Interactive Visualization**: Graph-based exploration of research connections and treatment pathways

## API Usage Examples

### Basic Health Query

Query the system for general medical advice:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://jovana.openbrain.io/v3/retrieval/agent" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": {"role": "user", "content": "I have a fever of 102Â°F and headache. What should I do?"}, 
    "search_settings": {"use_semantic_search": true}
  }'
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "results": {
    "messages": [{
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'm not a doctor, but here are some general steps you can take if you have a fever and headache:\n\n1. **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of fluids such as water, herbal teas, or clear broths to stay hydrated.\n\n2. **Rest:** Ensure you get plenty of rest to help your body fight off any infection.\n\n3. **Over-the-Counter Medication:** Consider taking over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help reduce fever and alleviate headache pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the package.\n\n4. **Cool Compress:** Apply a cool, damp cloth to your forehead to help reduce fever.\n\n5. **Monitor Symptoms:** Keep an eye on your symptoms. If your fever persists for more than a couple of days, or if you experience severe symptoms, it's important to seek medical attention.\n\n6. **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** If you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen, contact a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your specific situation.\n\nRemember, these are general suggestions, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for medical advice."
